I'm a first year PhD student at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> in the <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)</a> department. Currently, I'm working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/">Kate Starbird</a> to start a new project on wearable technology (<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>, <a href="http://www.catapultsports.com/">Catapult</a>, etc.) in college athletics. In the Winter 2017 quarter I will be continuing this project with <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/mcdonald">David McDonald</a>.
