			<h5 class="card-title">UX Design: The Game for You</h5>
			<p class="card-text">
				In the summer of 2018, I taught my first course as the primary instructor 
				for UX Design: The Game for You, a course that is part of the 
				<a href=https://robinsoncenter.uw.edu/">Robinson Center</a> Summer Stretch
				Program. The Robinson Center and this program is geared towards highly capable 
				young pre-college and college students. Thus, while my students were 15 years old, 
				I taught similar material to that taught at a college level.
				
				Over this five week intensive course, students learned the UX design process 
				in the context of board game design. Each week was devoted to a different 
				part of the process. In week one, we started by understanding our context,
				game design. Then, in week two, we conducted user research, followed by 
				ideation, sketching and prototyping in week three. Finally in weeks four 
				and five, the students iterated on their games before their final presentations
				on the last day. As part of the class we also had a programming bootcamp 
				day where the students learned p5.js and Git, and we took a field trip 
				downtown to Amazon. All lectures were designed from scratch. Insipration 
				for journal reflection and homework assignments came from Pierre Delcourt, 
				the previous instructor for this course.

			<p class="card-text">
				In the first iteration of this course for the new <a href="https://gix.uw.edu/">Global Innovation
					Exchange (GIX)</a>
				Program in Bellevue, WA, I assisted <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/craft">Brock Craft</a> in
				running
				peer reviews during class and assessing the student's work. The focus of this course was on the process
				of designing
				and prototyping in 2D and 3D, which means we emphasized iterating on design instead of creating a
				perfect design.
				Despite having no prior experience with designing in 2D and 3D, my background in CS, HCI, and HCDE was
				useful in
				emphasizing the need to "fail early and often" in the design process. Additionally, by the end of the
				quarter I
				had developed competency in Adobe Illustrator and laser cutting.

			<p class="card-text">

				<a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/davidson">Andy Davidson</a> and I worked to create a two-credit
				curriculum for this course that would teach 35 students basic programming concepts (variables,
				conditionals,
				functiions, parameters, loops, and arrrays) in 10 weeks. Students were taught to program in
				<a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library of the language <a
					href="https://processing.org/">
					Processing</a>. These languages were specifically developed to make coding accessible for
				beginningers,
				a main goal of this course. The course included six assignments that reinforced each of these six
				concepts.
				Students were always encouraged to be creative with the assignments and the final project was completely
				open-ended, though students were encouraged to as much as they could of what they learned. Though the
				students
				had a range of programming experience, the purpose of a slow pace was to give students a solid grounding
				in basic concepts so that they could continue learning on their own after the course. Also, for some
				students,
				this course helped them better understand the challenges developers face.
