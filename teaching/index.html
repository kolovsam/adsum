<h2> Teaching </h2>


TA for HCDE 598a (Introduction to Programming in p5.js) in Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. This spring (2018) I will be one of the TA's for TECHIN 511 (Fabrication and Physical Prototyping), a new course taught by <<a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/craft">Brock Craft</a> at the <a href="https://gix.uw.edu/">Global Innovation Exchange (GIX)</a> in Bellevue, WA. Please check out the links below to see student work from these classes (Note: Some of the js scripts don't run, which is a bug I have yet to figure out).

<h3>HCDE 598a Fall 2017</h3>
<a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/davidson">Andy Davidson</a> and I worked to create a two-credit curriculum for this course that would teach 35 students basic programming concepts (variables, conditionals, functiions, parameters, loops, and arrrays) in 10 weeks. Students were taught to program in <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library of the language <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. These languages were specifically developed to make coding accessible for beginningers, a main goal of this course. The course included six assignments that reinforced each of these six concepts. Students were always encouraged to be creative with the assignments and the final project was completely open-ended, though students were encouraged to as much as they could of what they learned. Though the students had a range of programming experience, the purpose of a slow pace was to give students a solid grounding in basic concepts so that they could continue learning on their own after the course. Also, for some students, this course helped them better understand the challenges developers face.

<h3>HCDE 598a Winter 2018</h3>
Brock Craft and I made slight modifications to the Fall course to keep the last few weeks focused on graphics and interative programming as opposed to more typical computer science problems. This course only included six students in this iteration, hence the single gallery page.
