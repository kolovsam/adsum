                I recently earned my PhD at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of
                    Washington</a>
                in the department of <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)</a>. 
                    With guidance from my advisors <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/">
                    Kate Starbird</a> and <a href="http://www.smunson.com/">Sean Munson</a>, I explored the use of tracking technology (e.g., <a

                    Catapult</a>, <a href="http://whoop.com/">WHOOP</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">
                    Fitbit</a>, etc.) and data in college athletics. In August 2022 I defended my dissertation,

                In May 2016, I graduated from <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>
                with a BS in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">
                    College of Information and Computer Science (CICS)</a>. I also completed the
                Commonwealth Honors College program with an undergraduate capstone project. This
                project was a part of my work in the <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu/index.shtml">
                    LASER</a> Lab where I was advised by <a

                I have been rowing since 2008 (15 years as of 2023). I was
                lucky to start in high school and later compete as a Division
                I NCAA student-athlete for the 
                <a href="http://www.umassathletics.com/index.aspx?path=wrow">

            <p class="card-text">
                I am also fortunate that rowing has taken me up and down the east
                coast, to Oklahoma City, St. Catharine's in Ontario, Henley and London
                in England, and Israel. By extension you could argue thatrowing has 
                also taken me to grad school/Seattle, Mexico City, Denver, Montreal, 
                Scotland, and Amsterdam.

                I currently still row in Seattle out of LWRC in my single, Anduril,
                named after Aragorn's sword from the Lord of the Rings.

                I have always enjoyed singing, but singing sounds better with 
                accompanyment. So I picked up guitar as my dissertation hobby 
                (a hobby one picks up to balance out writing a disserration) 
                and my pandemic hobby.
