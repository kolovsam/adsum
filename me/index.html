  <h2> About Me </h2>

  I'm a fourth year PhD student at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>
  in the <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)</a>
  department. Currently, I'm working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/">
      Kate Starbird</a> and <a href="http://www.smunson.com/">Sean Munson</a> to start
  a new project exploring the use of tracking technology (e.g., <a href="http://www.catapultsports.com/">
      Catapult</a>, <a href="http://whoop.com/">WHOOP</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">
      Fitbit</a>, etc.) and data in college athletics. In this 2019-2020 academic year
  I published my first paper on my first author work and I am working on my general exam.
