    <h3>
      <a href="projects-sports.html">Personal Data in College Athletics</a>
    </h3>

    <i>Ongoing.</i> I am leading this project under the advisement of Kate Starbird, Sean Munson, and David McDonald.
    This past September we submitted a paper to the SIGCHI conference about the organizational practices in college
    athletics
    around athlete tracking data. Last year, I ran a directed research group with HCDE students and UW student-athletes
    to
    design, conduct, and analyze athlete interviews exploring goals and concerns for collection and use of tracking
    data.

    <h3>
      <a href="projects-brighten.html">Brighten App UX Study</a>
    </h3>

    <i>2018-2019.</i> I am working on this project as a research assistant in Dr. Pat Arean's CREATIV lab
    in UW Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. We aim to develop a mobile mental health app, called "Brighten",
    designed to deliver assessments and interventions to people experiencing symptoms of depression. More
    details on this project will be added when our study is complete.

    <h3>
      <a href="projects-pivotal-moments.html">Pivotal Moments</a>
    </h3>

    <i>2016-2017.</i> I worked on this project in a Directed Research Group led by fellow HCDE PhD student Aprita
    Bhattacharya.
    Abstract: Most health technologies are designed to support people who have already decided to work toward better
    health.
    Thus, there remains an opportunity to design technologies to help motivate people who have not yet decided to make a
    change.
    Understanding the experiences of people who have already started to make a health behavior change and how they made
    that
    pivotal decision can be useful in understanding how to design such tools. In this paper, we describe results from
    surveys
    with 244 adults who have decided to make a behavior change and interviews with 25 adults who have either already
    accomplished
    their behavior change(s) or are currently working toward them. We identified four factors that lead to pivotal
    experiences:
    (1) prolonged discontent and desire to change, (2) significant changes that increase fear or hope of future, (3)
    increased
    understanding of oneâ€™s behavior and personal data, and (4) social accountability. We also describe a design space
    for designing
    technology-based interventions for encouraging people to decide to make a change to improve their health. We discuss
    opportunities
    for further exploration of the design of for people who are not yet motivated to change and for ethical
    considerations for
    this type of intervention.

    <h3>
      <a href="projects-agndmp.html">SmartChecklist Post-Documentation</a>
    </h3>

    <i>2014-2016.</i> My honors research project. I improved upon an existing tool for
    automatically generating process narrative documentation and I created
    a new tool for automatically generating post documentation for medical
    procedures.
