    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    
    <a href="/projects/sports/index.html">Personal Data in College Athletics.</a>
    <i>2016-Present.</i>
    I am leading this project with my advisors Sean Munson and Kate Starbird. 
    We recently had our <a href="/publications/power-in-sports.html">first paper on this project</a> 
    published. As part of this project, I ran three directed research groups (DRGs) in the 2017-2018 
    academic year. HCDE students and UW student-athletes worked together to design, conduct, and 
    analyze athlete interviews exploring goals and concerns for collection and use of tracking data.
