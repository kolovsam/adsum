      <h2>UX for a Mobile Mental Health Intervention</h2>
   
        <!--TODO: update using resume and add design screenshots-->
        
        I worked on this project as a research assistant in Dr. Pat Arean's CREATIV lab
        in UW Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. I conducted a study to get feedback on a mobile mental health 
        app for long-term remote digital health studiies designed to deliver assessments and interventions to 
        people experiencing symptoms of depression. This study aimed to improve the design of this app 
        for future studies, and better understand how to keep participants engaged and understand their 
        perspectives on passive sensing.
