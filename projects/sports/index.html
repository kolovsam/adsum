      <h2>Personal Data in College Athletics</h2>
      
      <i>Ongoing.</i> I am leading this project with my advisors Sean Munson and Kate Starbird. 
      We recently had our <a href="/publications/power-in-sports.html">first paper on this project</a> 
      published. As part of this project, I ran three directed research groups (DRGs) in the 2017-2018 
      academic year. HCDE students and UW student-athletes worked together to design, conduct, and 
      analyze athlete interviews exploring goals and concerns for collection and use of tracking data.
