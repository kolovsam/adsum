      <h2>Design and Use of Sports Tracking Technology</h2>
      
      <p>
        For my dissertation work I am leading this project with guidance 
        from my faculty advisors Sean Munson and Kate Starbird.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goals of this project are to understand:
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>
            How sports tracking data <i>should be</i> collected and used within college sports teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            How designers and practitioners can balance the tensions between the goals and needs of
            different roles (e.g., student-athletes, coaches, and athletic trainers) around tracking data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of this project I have led six <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/directed">
        directed research groups (DRGs)</a> where I have
        brought together student-athletes with HCDE and design students to work together on
        my research studies. Across these studies we have: 
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>Designed, conducted, and analyzed interview data from 30+ interviews
              with student-athletes, college coaches and staff, and designers of 
              sports tracking technology.
          </li>
          <li>
              <a href="https://kolovsam.com/speculating-future-sports-tech/">
                Designed and developed three videos using a speculative design approach</a>. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        So far I have published <a href="/publications/power-in-sports.html">one paper on this project</a>. 
        I am to publish the findings from the rest of my work will in one or two future papers.
