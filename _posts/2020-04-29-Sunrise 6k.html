One of the things I've enjoyed most about this quarentined time is finding weird stuff
in Ballard. Inspired by finding the Castle in the Sky Robot, when November Project announced
a virtual sunrise 6k for April 29th, I decided to make a route that covered 10 Weird/Fun/Interesting/Wonderful 
Ballard Landmarks:

<br><br>
<img src="/images/sunrise6k/landmarks-route.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><br>


<ol>
    <li>Edith Macefield’s House</li>
    <li>Murals on Ballard Ave</li>
    <li>Bell Tower</li>
    <li>Bergen Place Park</li>
    <li>Carnegie Library</li>
    <li>Leif Erickson Hall</li>
    <li>Castle in the Sky Robot (This one's the best)</li>
    <li>Street Markers</li>
    <li>Stone Living Room</li>
    <li>?????</li>
</ol>


Though finding the landmarks is fun in itself, I also wanted to make a mini-project
out of finding and synthesizing information about each as I think everyone should know
at least some history about the places they live. This turned out to be quite
a larger and more time consuming project than I intended, but I hope this is both
entertaining and informative (probably mostly informative, sorry not sorry). 
<br><br>

<b>#1 Edith Macefield’s House </b><br>
Though I must have passed it 100 times in the last couple years, I had no idea
that the "Up House", famous for it's previous owner 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Macefield">Edith Macefield</a>, 
was nestled into the Ballard Blocks or about the incredible stories about the house and 
it's owner.
Edith <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20060208&slug=danny08#_ga=2.248924996.2102346050.1588355698-572541021.1584641400">
    refused to give in to the developers of the Ballard Blocks who offered her $1 million for her home</a>,
so they built around her. This all went down in 2006, but Edith, who
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/edith-macefield-and-her-house-were-symbols-of-old-ballard/">just wanted to be left alone</a>,
died soon after in 2008 at the age of 86. She left everything to unlikely friend,
Barry Martin, the Ballard Blocks project superintendent. Barry, who wrote a book
about his friendship with Edith, was interviewed for this 
<a href="https://www.historylink.org/File/11092">history link essay</a> that covers
almost all of the information I was able to find online about Edith and her home (i.e. 
if you want to read the full story, this is most worth your time).
<br><br>
Possibly more intriguing than her home is her 
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/searching-for-edith-macefield/">
    mysterious past</a> (this Seattle Times article is the second best one to read for more
    info). According to her stories, she went to England at the age of 14
    and became a spy in Nazi Germany as a clarinet player at Hitler's parties. Later, she
    said she was acused of being a spy and was sent to Dachau, but later escaped, taking
    13 Jewish children with her. The story further continues with her marrying three or four 
    times. At least two of her husbands died (which seems suspicious to me) and another one 
    was named Macefield, whose name she took. She also said she had a son with one of them
    who died of spinal meningitis at the age of 13 and she said she adopted and raised 27 children.
     Eventually she moved back to the U.S. to take
    care of her mother in Ballard (in The house, where they both died). The chornological order of these 
    events and the facts differ in the accounts I have read. Reporters at the Seattle Times 
    were able to find little to no evidence to support the stories of Edith's past. They could 
    not confirm that Edith ever went to Europe and her marriage certificates seemed possiibly fake.
    The only evidence of anything outlandish that did seem true was the autographs that Edith collected
    in a little green book. Two thirds of these autographs--of famous people whose names I couldn't hope 
    to know other than Katharine Hepburn--were said to be true by an expert. 
    <br><br>
    So I guess we will have to settle for no knowing how much is true or not. Her home is not looking so good now, 
    just a boarded up empty shell, but while she was still alive
and for few years after it was well kept. The "Up" story was was not inspired by Edith's but as the 
stories are similar balloons were tied to the top of the house in 2009 to promote the movie. Multiple 
local Seattle news sources and Wikipedia cite that Disney paid for the balloon display to promote 
the movie, but there is no firm source for this information. The last fun fact I will leave you with is that
locals who admire Edith and her story got tattoos done which the blog site My Ballard calls, 
<a href="http://www.myballard.com/2009/03/26/edith-macefields-army-of-tattoos/">Edith Macefield's army of tattoos</a>.

<b>#2 Murals on Ballard Ave</b> <br>
As the shops on historic Ballard Ave boarded up for the pandemic, artists swooped in to 
paint the boards coving the shop windows. The result is really quite spectacular. Even
since I walked this way a few weeks ago, there is more art. All the art pieces are really
wonderful so it's hard to pick a favorite but I love the poem, We'll Hold Each Other Soon.

<br><br>
<b>#3 Bell Tower</b> <br>
The bell tower on the corner of 22nd and Ballard Ave houses the 
<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ballard-centennial-bell-tower">
1,000 pound bell that used to sit in Ballard's City Hall</a> when Ballard was 
it's own city. On May 30th, 1907, Ballard was annexed into Seattle and the bell 
was rung for the last time. The bell was restored to it's current position over 
70 years later after the demolition of the old city hall. It now is most notable
for marking the start and end of the farmer's market.

<br><br>
Far more interesting to me are the circumstances of Ballard's annexation.
The annexation is the root of one of Seattle greatest urban legends: the 
dead horse myth. I found out about this from a friend on social media several weeks 
ago when I shared my findings about #8 on my Instagram story. I had written that
Ballard became part of Seattle because their water supply could not support
their rapidly growing population. The myth is that Seattle put a dead horse in the
Ballard water supply that was the nail in the coffin that forced Ballard to
become part of Seattle. The Shingletown Saloon website certainly 
<a href="https://shingletownballard.com/2015/07/25/the-history-of-shingletown-part-2-of-ballard-city-history/">
paints a very colorful version of this story</a>. However 
<a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/what-are-seattles-urban-legends-and-are-they-true">
KOUW checked old newspapers on both sides</a>, Ballard and Seattle, and found no 
report of a dead horse even though the Ballard news covered the water supply issue plenty in 1906.


<br><br>
<b>#4 Bergen Place Park</b> <br>
<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bergen-place-park-and-mural">
Bergen Place Park</a> is named for Ballard's sister city of Bergen, Norway. Ballard
is historically home to many Scandinavian immigrants and this heritage is still
very much a part of the neighborhood and still celebrated, particularly at the
17th of May Parade. The mural, aims to represent this connection and the history
of Ballard with many symbols in the artwork (read the plaque picture). Though I
have known about these historical connections, I was glad I finally took the time
to read a bit more about them. However, one new piece of information stood out
because it gives an explanation for the name of the neighborhood country bar:
Ballard was known as "Shingletown, USA" in the early 1900s because more red cedar
shingles were produced here than anywhere else in the 50 states.


<br><br>
<b>#5 Carnegie Library</b> <br>
Currently home to the pub Kangaroo & Kiwi, this building has a 
<a href="https://seattle.curbed.com/2018/1/31/16953552/ballard-carnegie-library-building-history">
long history</a>. Like it's name suggests, most of the funds to
build the library came from Andrew Carnegie, but the Women's Christian
Temperance Union of Ballard is responsible for the efforts to form what
was first a reading room and later became the library. However, the
funds didn't cover books, but the Ballard community came together to
donate books to the library. This fact strikes me because of the many
of free little libraries that currently exist even within a few square 
blocks of the current library. 

<br><br>
<b>#6 Leif Erickson Hall</b> <br>
Leif Erickson Hall is home to the <a href="https://www.leiferiksonlodge.org/">
Sons of Norway Leif Erickson Lodge 2-001</a>. The Sons of Norway are historically
a fraternal benefit society (basically financial support organization for Norwegian
immigrants), but today they are also dedicated to creating community around preserving
Norwegian culture. On my 6k I took a picture with the bust of Leif that is in front 
of the hall on 57th street. There is a large fully body statue of Leif down at
Shilshole that I will have to go see at some point.


<br><br>
<b>#7 Castle In the Sky Robot </b><br>
I found this guy on a walk around Ballard a few weeks ago and became obessed
with finding out more about it and finding more Ballard oddities nearby. I
found that the robot is called the Castle in the Sky Robot and that the owner
of the house created him and they have a <a href="https://castleintheskyrobot.tumblr.com/">
Tumblr with more info and lots of pictures!</a>

<br><br>
<b>#8 Street Markers</b> <br>
A few weeks ago when I started going on quarentine walks, I finally bothered 
to find out about these street name mosaics on the sidewalk, which were clearly
not the current names of the streets. I found out that they were changed when 
Ballard was annexed into Seattle. <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Don-t-look-up-look-down-6424857.php#photo-8431666">
The markers on 20th are said to be originials but the ones on 24th were installed 
in the late 1990s by local artist Benson Shaw who made replicas of the ones on 20th</a>.
If you are curious about the old name of a street, check out this 
<a href="http://ba-kground.com/old-ballard-street-names/">table of the old names matched 
with their current one</a>


<br><br>
<b>#9 Stone Living Room</b> <br>
The stone living room is a fixture in the south end of Ballard Corners Park on 
17th Ave NW between NW 62nd and 63rd streets. The couches are cleverly crafted
because they look so real that you fully expect them to squish when touched but
indeed they are stone. When I did the 6k route, there was  
unfortunately a man sitting on one of the stone couches reading and smoking.
The stone living room is apparently a <a href="http://www.groundswellnw.org/ballard-corners-park">
tribute to the old corner store that used to be there</a>.

<b>#10 ????? </b> <br>
What will I find next? What will you? I love hearing about neighborhood landmarks
and local history. Please share with me on social media, @kolovsam, if you find something!
Seriously, I will add something here if you do!
