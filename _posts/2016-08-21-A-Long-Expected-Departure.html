"It is a dangerous business, going out of your door. You step onto the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might get swept off to." - J.R.R. Tolkien

Back in March, before I had even attended visit days at UW, before I had even booked plane tickets for the visit days, I was ecstatic about the idea of doing a cross country road trip and began planning. Sitting in my databases class, I was furiously. googling, recording, and mapping. It was not long before I had a rough itinerary together. But sitting there still months from graduation and plenty to enjoy in the months ahead, my plans seemed like a hazy description of a dream that you struggle to remember after waking up.

Now as it always does, everything that I looked forward to from then until now has passed by. Now the car is packed. And now we head out for a grand American adventure.
