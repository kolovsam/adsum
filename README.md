Seems like after two years I should probably update this. The additional content and major "refactoring" (via templates) mentioned two years ago was done sometime in the first half of 2016. Jekyll is easily available for github sites and so I used that to create templates for the sites. This made it much easier to make changes to the site without having to update the HTML in many places. Jekyll also makes it easy to curate a blog which I started for the various trips I took in summer of 2016. Since then the site has had only minor updates such as adding new pages to display publications and galleries of student work from the classes I have TA-ed. This week I have been making some larger changes such as the color scheme (I decided UW colors didn't look right), adding missing information and updating old information.

Very much under construction. Needs additional content and major refactoring/templating.
