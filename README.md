# Welcome
This repo is for my personal website: kolovsam.com

# How I built the site
The site is built entirely by me using the laughably minimal technical skills I picked up from my CS degree, the actual technical skills I learned from my first job at UMass IT, and my Googling skills mostly picked up from my UMass IT job where I figured out that pretty much any issue is addressed on StackOverflow and the internet has great information about how to create a website from scratch. 

And though it may not be fancy, I am proud to keep maintaining it myself.

# What I used to build the site
- HTML and CSS. 
- Bootstrap 5 for most of the CSS.
- Jekyll for templating. I also used to use this for a blog.
- Font Awesome for the social icons.
- Notion for my blog. Though this is not technical, I found that structuring my posts in HTML and CSS was tedious and so writing on Notion is pleasant and makes it easy to maintain.
- Google Docs for my resume and CV. At some point I realized it was silly to go through the step of downloading a PDF of my resume, moving it to my webiste docs folder, moving the old resume to an archive folder, and pushing that change to GitHub. Now I can update my resume or CV at any time and it is accesible and download-able through GDocs.
